<h1 class="title">OLIVE TREE SPECIES RECOGNITION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES</h1>

<section class="explanation">
    <p>
        The project explores how satellite imagery, when combined with image processing techniques and machine learning models, can be used to automatically classify tree species, focusing specifically on olive varieties in the Apulian region. The increasing availability of high-resolution multispectral images has opened new opportunities for environmental monitoring, allowing researchers to analyze vegetation with a level of precision that was previously difficult to obtain. In this context, the work aims to build a complete pipeline capable of transforming raw remote-sensing data into meaningful predictions about the identity of thousands of olive trees, demonstrating how computational tools can support biodiversity assessment and sustainable land management.    </p>
    <h3>Methodology:</h3>
    <p>
        The methodology begins with the construction of a structured and informative dataset. Two multispectral satellite images, each containing forty-seven spectral bands, are combined with binary masks that already segment the tree crowns. Field-collected GPS coordinates and labels describing the cultivar of each tree are imported and transformed into intrinsic image coordinates, enabling the alignment between ground-truth information and pixel-level data. Since manual measurements are prone to inaccuracies, some coordinates do not correspond to visible crowns and must be discarded to preserve dataset quality. Each crown in the segmented mask receives a unique identifier, and for every labeled tree, the corresponding pixels are extracted across all spectral bands. After masking out the background, the pixel values belonging to a single crown are filtered to remove outliers and averaged to produce a unique spectral signature. By repeating this process for all trees, the project obtains a matrix in which each row represents an olive tree and each column corresponds to the mean reflectance in one spectral band. This spectral information is then merged with geographic and cultivar data and exported as a complete dataset ready for classification.

        Once the dataset is prepared, the study evaluates several supervised learning algorithms to determine which model best discriminates between olive varieties. Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and multiple variants of Linear Discriminant Analysis are implemented after standard preprocessing steps that include normalization and an 80–20 train-test split with stratification. The models are trained exclusively on the spectral signatures extracted from the images, making classification depend entirely on the crowns’ reflectance characteristics. Each algorithm is assessed through accuracy and class-specific precision, recall, and F1-scores, supported by confusion matrices that reveal how frequently models mix up the different cultivars.
    </p>
    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>
        The results show that linear SVM and LDA with a linear discriminant perform the best, each reaching accuracy values close to seventy percent. These models manage to correctly classify most instances of the dominant cultivars, although rarer classes remain more challenging due to limited representation in the test set. Random Forests achieve slightly lower performance, around sixty percent accuracy, while the SVM with Gaussian kernel proves the least effective, consistently misclassifying nearly all samples except those belonging to a single abundant variety. Overall, the findings demonstrate that spectral information alone provides a meaningful basis for differentiating olive species and that linear decision boundaries, rather than more complex nonlinear strategies, capture these differences most effectively.    </p>
