<h1 class="title">POLITICAL BLOGS CLASSIFICATION USING GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS (GCN)</h1>

<section class="explanation">
    <p>
        The project investigates whether political orientation can be inferred from a combination of textual content and graph-structured relationships between blogs. The underlying problem is framed as a node classification task in which each blog must be assigned a conservative or liberal label. To address this challenge, the work integrates transformer-based textual embeddings with graph neural network architectures, building on the idea that political leaning emerges not only from what a blog writes but also from how it is positioned and connected within a broader hyperlink network. This dual-source perspective makes the task particularly well suited for models able to combine semantic signals with structural dependencies.
    </p>
    <h3>Methodology:</h3>
    <p>
        The methodology begins with the construction of a meaningful graph from the polblogs.gml dataset. The original data contained inconsistencies such as duplicate edges and non-functional URLs, which required cleaning. At first a multigraph was created to preserve the duplicated structural information and then reduced it to a simple directed graph where duplicates were treated as single edges with higher cardinality. Only nodes corresponding to valid webpages, determined through URL validation and HTTP status checks, were included, ensuring a coherent topology for downstream learning.
        A central component of the methodology lies in the generation of textual embeddings. Because many blog posts exceeded the 512-token limit of the MiniLM encoder, a multi-step summarization pipeline was employed. Each document was divided into chunks and individually summarized using the facebook-bart-large-cnn model, merged, and summarized again to obtain a condensed yet semantically meaningful representation. These summaries were then encoded with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, producing 384-dimensional vectors subsequently reduced to 50 principal components via PCA to accelerate training without significant loss of expressivity.
        With these embeddings serving as node features, three graph neural architectures (GCN, ChebNet, and GAT) were implemented. Each shared the same high-level structure of three convolutional layers, nonlinear activations, dropout, and a final classification layer, differing only in the type of convolution applied. A rigorous cross-validation strategy was adopted, employing five folds and exploring a parameter grid over learning rate, weight decay, and hidden dimensions. Multiple optimizers, including Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad, were compared. This phase involved continuous interaction between data loading, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, ensuring a systematic search for the most effective configuration.

    </p>
    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>
        The results demonstrate strong performance across architectures, with the best models achieving accuracy values above 94%. Confusion matrices and loss curves highlight the stability of training and the ability of GCN and GAT-based models paired with Adam or RMSProp to generalize well. Models trained with Adagrad performed noticeably worse due to their sensitivity to learning-rate schedules. The analysis concludes that while all architectures captured relevant structural and semantic patterns, attention-based models provided a slight but consistent advantage. Overall, the approach confirms that integrating transformer embeddings with graph-aware learning provides a powerful framework for predicting political orientation from interconnected online discourse.
