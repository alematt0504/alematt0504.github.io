<h1 class="title">ONTOLOGY-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING TASKS ENHANCING</h1>

<section class="explanation">
    <p>
        This project investigates whether a machine learning model can be strengthened by enriching its input features through ontology-driven knowledge augmentation. Instead of relying solely on the raw attributes of a dataset, the work aims to infuse semantic structure, domain relationships, and inferred patterns derived from a diabetes ontology into the learning process. The motivation is clear: ontologies encode expert knowledge and contextual relationships that traditional datasets cannot capture directly, and integrating this information may enhance predictive performance, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine and finance. The project therefore attempts to formalize a pipeline in which clinical data about patients is mapped into an ontology, expanded through logical reasoning, transformed into embeddings, and finally aggregated with the original dataset for training a classifier to predict diabetes.
    </p>
    <h3>Methodology:</h3>
    <p>
        The methodology is structured around several key stages, starting with the choice of embedding models. While OWL2Vec* was initially adopted due to its comprehensive handling of both ontology semantics and structure, the project eventually favored Node2Vec because of its superior scalability and execution speed. The OWL2Vec* framework, generates embeddings from structure and lexical documents derived from the ontology, but requires computationally expensive reasoning and corpus construction. Node2Vec, by contrast, treats the ontology as a graph and performs random walks to learn node embeddings efficiently, making it more suitable for iterative experimentation and hyperparameter tuning .

        A crucial methodological step involves the formal integration between dataset and ontology. The system requires the dataset to follow a strict structure (an ID column, a set of features, and a target variable—paired with an ontology containing a main individual class and SWRL rules). Each dataset row becomes an ontology individual whose features are translated into data properties. Pellet is then used to infer new axioms; for example, a high BMI automatically links a patient to the Obesity concept, thereby enriching the graph with new clinically meaningful relations.
        Once ontology embeddings are generated they are horizontally concatenated with the original dataset, producing an enhanced dataset that feeds into a neural network classifier. The network consists of three linear layers with sigmoid activations, processing both original and ontology-derived features.
    </p>
    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <p>
        The results demonstrate the practical value of this enriched representation. With 1000 samples, performance gains were minimal, indicating that small datasets do not provide enough statistical grounding to benefit substantially from ontology expansion. However, when the dataset size increased to 2000 samples, the enhanced dataset using Node2Vec produced a marked improvement, raising accuracy to nearly 92% compared to the baseline’s 88.75%, and showing corresponding gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings support the central hypothesis: ontology-driven feature augmentation can significantly enhance machine learning predictions, provided that the dataset is sufficiently large to leverage the added semantic structure.    </p>
